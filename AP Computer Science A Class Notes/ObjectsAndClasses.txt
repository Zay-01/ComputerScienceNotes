-----
Objects -> Variables and Methods seperated
Class -> Variables and Methods used together

Object is a copy of a class put into memory(Instance)
-----

-----
Overloading -> Same method  name, but different parameters

.subString(s);
.subString(5,7);

Two ways to use them!

double math.abs(double a)
float math.abs(double a)
-----

-----
Constructor - Used to initialize variables when a new object is created

Java creates a no-argument default - You wont see it in text
**IF** you write one, java no longer creates a default constructor
------

------
Garbage -> When something isnt pointed at anymore it becomes "garbage" aka the data no longer exist for it 
Garbage Collector -> Cleans up garbage so new objects can take its spot
^Happens automatically in java, 
------

------
public String toString()
{
    return int + " " + int;
}
will print this out if i did sysout(objectHere), java seeks this but if it cant find it, it will print out the 
memory address of the object

String is the only object without a new keyword used, due to frequent usage

charAt(0) will return the first char at index of 0
indexOf("at", index+1) will give u second occurance of "at"


trick to convert a number to a string
String s;
int i = 37;
s = i + ""
"" -> Empty String

Concatenate Strings (to join strings together)

Sysout("java" + (1+2)) will output java3 because when it reaches the paranthesis it will add and do whatever math is needed
Sysout("java" + 1 + 2 ) will first add java and 1 together giving java1, then +2 will add a 2 to the java1 making it java12
