Objects -> Variables and Methods seperated
Class -> Variables and Methods used together

Object is a copy of a class put into memory(Instance)
-----

-----
Overloading -> Same method  name, but different parameters

.subString(s);
.subString(5,7);

Two ways to use them!

double math.abs(double a)
float math.abs(double a)
-----

-----
Constructor - Used to initialize variables when a new object is created

Java creates a no-argument default - You wont see it in text
**IF** you write one, java no longer creates a default constructor
------

------
Garbage -> When something isnt pointed at anymore it becomes "garbage" aka the data no longer exist for it 
Garbage Collector -> Cleans up garbage so new objects can take its spot
^Happens automatically in java, 
------

------
public String toString()
{
    return int + " " + int;
}

String class is the only object without a new keyword used frequently 
------

------
charAt(0)
indexOf("at", index+1) will give u second occurance

Concatenate Strings
(to join strings together)
trick to convert a number to a string
String s;
int i = 37;
s = i + ""
"" -> Empty String
