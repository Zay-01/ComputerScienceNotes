-- Method Structure --
<VISIBILITY> <ReturnType> <methodName>(parameters) {
    // method body
}

Refer to MethodsVisibilityReturnTypes for above^

-- Constructors --

Constructors -> Allows you to initilize variables within a class 

If i did 

for(int i = 0; i < arraySizeHere; i++)
{
    Song[] album = new Song(time, title)
}

Song class:
public Song(String time,String title)
{
    private String timeString = time;
    private String titleString = title;
}

Now my Album[i] has a constructor where i can intialize time and the title of a song on a album.

-- Overloading --

OverLoading -> When you have two methods but they have different parameters
Two ways to use them!

double math.abs(<double a>)
float math.abs(<float a>)
so i can pass in a int, double, float and it wont show errors, if i did a int in a double method then id get a error

-- Garbage --
A method, class/object, variable and more can become garbage when theres nothing pointing to it, this gets 
garbage collected as that object/instance becomes garbage


-- How to start a project? --
public class <name>
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        //The machine finds this keyword and runs only within these code blocks 
    }
}

-- How to create a object? --

<Class name> <name> = new <Class name>(Parameters)

This tells java i want to create a object, my object will be sc for example:

Scanner sc = new Scanner();

i want to use my blueprints and make a new object/instance with it so i tell java what my variable is (sc)
then i tell java i want to make this new object for scanner and i want sc to point at it for the duration 
of my program
