Encapsulation -> Hiding variables to make it harder to modify them, this is how we make
things more secure when storing and modifying data on the backend

-- Visibility --
Modifiers -> Final and Visibility
Final -> Makes the variable a constant, unable to be changed ever but can be used
Visibility -> Public and Private
Private -> Only visible to that class and cant be interacted with by other classes so if i did
Public -> Other classes can use these variables or Methods

-- Example --
BankAccount account1 = new BankAccount(time, name);
account1.currentBalance = 9532847283; //NOT POSSIBLE TO MODIFY!!!!
//**IF** i had a getter method:
System.out.println(account1.getDolla()); //id be able to get the value only
However, what if its restricted to account1 only? then i cant get a value
