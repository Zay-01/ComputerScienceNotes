Encapsulation -> Hiding variables to make it harder to modify them 

Modifiers -> Final and Visibility
Visibility -> Public and Private

Private -> Only visible to that class and cant be interacted with by other classes so if i did
Public -> Other classes can use these variables or Methods

Song album = new album(time, name);
album.timeSeconds = 9532847283; //NOT POSSIBLE!!!!!!!

I cant change the time once i constructed this object because its private unless i had a setter method
or a method which allowed me to modify the variable (this is equivelent to using public but with extra steps)
