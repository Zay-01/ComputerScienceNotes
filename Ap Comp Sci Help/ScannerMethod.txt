import java.util.Scanner;
import java.io.*;

Scanner lets us take in inputs from a user that being typing in the terminal or from a file!

--Reading terminal input--
{
    Scanner sc = new Scanner();
    int hi = sc.next();
    String e = sc.nextLine();
    //SIMPLE!!!
}

--Reading from a file--

{
    Scanner sc = new Scanner(new File("FILE.TXT"))
    try
    {
        int hi = sc.next();
    }

    sc.close(); //To avoid resource leaks 

    catch(IOException e)
    {
        Sysout(e);
    }

}

since this is taking things from another file, errors can occur with pathing and what not so thats where the 
IOException appears to catch it so your code can still run
