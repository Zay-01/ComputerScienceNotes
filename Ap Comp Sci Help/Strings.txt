Strings are specially designed objects able to contain multiple characters! 
New keyword is never used for strings since its a frequently used object

.charAt() returns a char at a certain index
.Length -> Returns length

----- Example -----
charAt(0) will return the first char at index of 0
indexOf("at", index+1) will give u second occurance of "at"

----- toString -----
public String toString()
{
    return int + " " + int;
}
will print this out if i did sysout(objectHere), java seeks this but if it cant find it, it will print out the 
memory address of the object

----- Trick -----
trick to convert a number to a string
String s;
int i = 37;
s = i + ""
"" -> Empty String

------ Concatenate ------
Concatenate Strings (to join strings together)

Sysout("java" + (1+2)) will output java3 because when it reaches the paranthesis it will add and do whatever math is needed
Sysout("java" + 1 + 2 ) will first add java and 1 together giving java1, then +2 will add a 2 to the java1 making it java12
