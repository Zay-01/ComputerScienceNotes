Arrays are simple! If you want multiple varibles or objects stored within the same phrase 
lets say we want to store multiple integers, you would have to make multiple objects however a arraay 
prevents you from suffering that and having to take more RAM 

To declare a array

int[] <name> = new int(size)

Arrays indexing starts from 0 and is inclusive meaning if i had a size of 5 for a array itd actually be 0-4 still same size but how you call it is different!

System.out.println(name[0]) will output the first number stored!
System.out.println(name[4]) will output the last number stored!

so instead of making multiple pointers that take up storage you can have one pointer that points at 5 different numbers and says "hey i store all of these pls dont garbage collect"  (its also easier and cleaner)

-- Iterate a array --
to iterate over a array 
for(int i = 0; i < <name>.length; i++)
so "i" will go through the entire array length!

2D arrays are like tables, a table has a row and collunm
int[][] <name> = new int[rowSize][collumnSize]

for(int i = 0; i< <name>.length; i++) this will refer to the row size!
{
    for(int j = o; j< <name>[0].length; i++) this will refer to the collumn size!
}

A 2D array actually just stores another array inside it like a row would be students and each student will have a test score 
Sysout(name[0][2]) it will output the first rows, 3rd collumn!

-- For Each Loop --
This loop iterates through a entire array! You cant modify values so be aware

for(String name: <ArrayHere>)
{
    System.out.println("name: " + name)
}
