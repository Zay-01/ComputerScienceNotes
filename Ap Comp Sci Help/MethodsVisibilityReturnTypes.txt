-- Method Structure --
<VISIBILITY> <ReturnType> <methodName>(parameters) 
{
    // method body
}

public void name()
{
    //returs nothing so no return expected
}

-- Visibility --
private -> only this class can access variables and methods marked as private 
public -> all classes can access variables and methods marked as public

-- Return Types --
int, char, double, boolean, String, arrays, etc.  
void -> nothing is returned  
NOTE: THE METHOD STOPS THE MOMENT YOU GET A VALUE RETURNED! Only exception is a void method 
where it just ends after it does the final line of code within

-- Getter vs Setter --
Getter -> returns a variable’s value (read-only)  
Setter -> updates a variable’s value (write-only, usually void)  

-- Example --
Driver class:
- Contains a Calculator object

Calculator class method:
public int speedRate(int car) {
    return car - 100;
}

Driver code:
int car = 4;
int carSpeed = calculator.speedRate(car);
// carSpeed = -96

-- Notes --
- Parameters can be named anything (car, house, x, etc.)  
- The return type must match what is returned
