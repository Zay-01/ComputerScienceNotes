Objects -> Variables and Methods seperated
Class -> Variables and Methods used together

Object is a copy of a class put into memory(aka Instance)

-----
Overloading -> Same name, but different numbers and parameters

.subString(s);
.subString(5,7);

Two ways to use them!

double math.abs(double a)
float math.abs(double a)

-----

Constructor - Used to initialize variables when a new object is created

Java creates a no-argument default - You wont see it in text
**IF** you write one, java no longer creates a default constructor

------

Garbage -> When something isnt pointed at anymore it beocmes "garbage" aka the data no longer exist for it 
Garbage Collector -> Cleans up garbage so new objects can take its spot
^Happens automatically in java,
